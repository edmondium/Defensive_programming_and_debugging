# Welcome to Defensive Programming and Debugging

This material complements the content of the FutureLearn MOOC on
["Defensive programming and debugging"](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/defensive-programming-and-debugging).

This is an online resource for defensive programming and debugging.  You will
find material on
* coding best practices
* error handling
* defensive programming
* documenting your code
* unit and functional testing
* debuggers (gdb, valgrind)
* taxonomy of bugs
* references and further reading

This is mainly aimed at scientific and high performance computing, so examples
are given for C, C++ and Fortran.  However, the principles are very similar for
other programming languages.
