# Defensive programming and debugging.

The text can be conveniently read on the
[Github pages site](https://gjbex.github.io/DPD-online-book/)
for this repository.  The material complements that of the FutureLearn MOOC
on ["Defensive programming and debugging"](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/defensive-programming-and-debugging).

This is an online resource for defensive programming and debugging.  You will
find material on
* coding best practices
* error handling
* defensive programming
* documenting your code
* unit and functional testing
* debuggers (gdb, valgrind)
* taxonomy of bugs
* references and further reading

This is mainly aimed at scientific and high performance computing, so examples
are given for C, C++ and Fortran.  However, the principles are very similar for
other programming languages.

## Source code

Source code illustrating various kinds of bugs and the use of tools can be found in
the [source code directory](source_code/).
