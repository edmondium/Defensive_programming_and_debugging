# Mpi
Sample code with various problems to explore using a parallel debugger
such as Arm DDT, Intel ITAC and MUST.

## What is it?
1. `Correctness`: illustrations of using Must to detect MPI issues at
    runtime.
1. `DdtC`: some C examples of buggy code to illustrate DDT.
1. `DdtFortran`: some Fortran examples of buggy code to illustrate DDT.
1. `Itac`: some code to illustrate the use of ITAC.
1. `PointToPointFortran`: some application to illustrate potential
    for deadlock and data races in point-to-point communication.
