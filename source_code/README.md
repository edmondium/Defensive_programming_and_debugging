# Debugging
Some sample code to illustrate the use of debugging tools.  Also some unit
testing code is shown, since trying to prevent bugs is better than fixing
them.

This part of the repository is
supplemented by the following repository:
* [Defenesive programming and debugging](https://github.com/gjbex/DPD-online-book)


## What is it?
1. `Arithmetic`: illustrations of arithmetic bugs.
1. `Catch2`: very simple illustrations of using Catch2 for C++ unit
    testing and BDD.
1. `ClangTidy`: code to experiment with `clang-tidy`.
1. `Const`: illustrates some subtleties of `const` declarations in C/C++.
1. `ControlFlow`: illustrations of bugs in the control flow.
1. `MemoryIssues`: sample code to illustrate various memory issues.
1. `CodeCoverage`: illustration of how to use code coverage tools.
1. `CompilerFlags`: illustration of the value of specifying maximal warnings
    when compiling, as well as trying multiple compilers.
1. `CppPitfalls`: illustration of C++ specific bugs.
1. `CppCheck`: illustration of what the Cppcheck static analyzer can catch.
1. `CUnit`: very simple illustration of how to use the CUnit testing
    framework for testing C code.

1. `GitBisect`: illustration of using `git bisect` to find the first bad
    commit.
1. `Heisenbugs`: illustration of bugs that have a level of
    non-deterministic behaviour.
